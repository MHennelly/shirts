      <p>how it works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you make an order</li>
        <li>we confirm order with you, we only do on-demand private sales</li>
        <li>we generate a hash of a unique, secret passphrase</li>
        <li>we print the shirt and write the passphrase on it</li>
        <li>we mint an nft of the shirt as indestructible proof we sold it</li>
        <li>you get the t-shirt and passphrase</li>
      </ul>
      <p>why it works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you can only create the hash if you know the secret passphrase</li>
        <li>this means bootlegs are easily spotted</li>
        <li>if the tee doesn't have a hash we've minted before then it's definitely bootleg</li>
        <li>if it does have a hash we've minted before, then it's only legit if the seller can re-create the hash</li>
        <li>only legit sellers can re-create the hash because only they know the tee's passphrase</li>
        <li>a tee is only bootleg-safe as long as the passphrase is kept secret by all previous owners</li>
      </ul>
